# Milker quick level-up

## Memory locations


## Summary
The milkerâ€™s experience is not reset to 0 when you level it up. It remains at 100%. This results in the milker increasing by one level every single time you use the tool. Since higher levels give you one extra bottle of milk per use (for a maximum of 100 bottles at level 99), this can be used to ship a lot of milk relatively quickly.

## Method
Just mash Y until the milker is at level 1 (this takes about 15 real-world minutes). Subsequent uses will cause the milker to level up instantly. In total, you will need to milk the air 765 times.
